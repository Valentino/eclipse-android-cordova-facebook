=============

Eclipse project for a skeleton web app for Android with native Facebook Connect integration thanks to Phonegap/Cordova 2.0 and plugins. 

Ready to run with Hackbook example and all the fixes as of 10/9/2012.
Just replace YOUR_APP_ID with your Facebook App ID in assets/www/index.html and make sure you've generated your Android hash key correctly and saved it in your app settings on Facebook.
